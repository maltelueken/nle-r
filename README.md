# nle-r
Neural likelihood inference in R.

## Requirements

Loading the NLE in R requires the R packages `keras3` and `reticulate` and Python (> 3.10) to be 
installed as well as the Python packages `bayesflow==2.0.0` and `tensorflow`.

Training the NLE requires the Python packages `bayesflow==2.0.0` and a Keras backend to be installed. Installing a backend with GPU support is recommended for training.
